<h2>Clion - run / debug steals cursor focus</h2>

<p>This one trips me up every time, as it's not really an issue with Clion
itself, rather it's how the <a
href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">intellij-rust</a>
defaults work. When running or debugging a test (or the binary) from the IDE,
the editor steals focus from the window with the code, and one either has to
use the mouse, or some other combination of shortcuts to return to the code.
This disrupts your "flow". Annoying.</p>

<p>To fix this, one must configure the <i>Cargo Run/Debug template</i> to not
steal focus. Open the test / run configuration window ("Edit
configurations..."). In the bottom left, select "Edit configuration
templates...". Select "Cargo". <i>Uncheck</i> "Activate tool window" (at the
bottom). Hit "Apply", then "OK".</p>

<p>One should also remove all of the existing configurations, as they'll most
likely have the default behavior associated with them.</p>

<p>Now, when you run / debug a test / binary for the first time, your
configuration will not steal focus.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there's an <a

 about this on the plugin's GitHub page</a>.</p>
