Stuff in here is just a random collection of things that I've picked up along
the way, inspired by Reddit's [r/til](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned).

Think Bash one-liners and useful CLI commands for various things, structured in
a way that makes it easy for me to search for when I need it.
