<h1>ConfigMaps, Secrets and InitContainers</h1>

<p>
    New Year (kind of), new job, and another chance to say that I'm going to be
    serious about writing longer form pieces of content for my site. The new job
    part is probably the biggest motivation, as I'm going to be working
    extensively with scalable cloud infrastructure built out on top of k8s. This
    which serves as a great opportunity to write about what I'm learning along
    the way. Fun!
</p>

<p>
    This post is going to detail a problem I had to work around this week
    related to configuration changes and version control.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, the problem I was faced with was in a project that had a
    directory structure like the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">repo/
config-file1.ini
config-file2.ini
deployment.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>config-file*.ini</code> files looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-plain">
...
[database]
password = changeme
host = localhost
...
</code></pre>

<p>
    The <code>deployment.yaml</code> file represents a typical k8s <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/"><code>Deployment</code></a>.
    This case, the end result is simply printing out the contents of the
    configuration files, to prove that we can see everything that we need to run
    our app (i.e. the passwords):
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: container-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'cat /etc/config/*; sleep 100']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: secrets
          secret:
            secretName: passwords
            items:
            - key: config-file-1
              path: config1.ini
            - key: config-file-2
              path: config2.ini
</code></pre>

<p>
    The config files contained secret information that couldn't be checked in
    (obviously), but it still had to be accessible to the k8s cluster. A <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/"><code>Secret</code></a>
    was used to store the contents of the <code>.ini</code> files in their
    <i>entirety</i>. Herein lies the problem!
</p>

<p>
    One of the benefits (in theory) of having configuration checked into version
    control, and having a solid CI pipeline is that when someone changes a
    configuration file, a pipeline is triggered to build and redeploy
    everything. In our case, this is done with <a
        href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> and <a
        href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the <code>Secret</code> had been created manually, using
    something like the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
stringData:
  config-file-1: |
   ...
   [database]
   password = real-password-1
   host = localhost
   ...
  config-file-2: |
   ...
   [database]
   password = real-password-2
   host = localhost
   ...
type: Opaque
</code></pre>

<p>
    The password had been put into place for the purposes of creating the
    <code>Secret</code> initially, and this had been stored in the cluster. The
    file had then been deleted.
</p>

<p>
    The problem arose when trying to alter some other configuration in the
    <code>.ini</code> files (for example, changing the hostname for the
    database), and assuming that the CI pipeline would push these changes out
    into the cluster. Given that the configuration was being mapped into the
    containers from the static <code>Secret</code>, getting the configuration
    change reflected would mean updating the Secret <i>manually</i>, creating a
    new yaml file, like before and applying the change to the cluster. Not
    ideal.
</p>

<p>
    Here's a little solution I came up with instead, that at its core, relies on
    a <code>ConfigMap</code> for the configuration <i>template</i>, a
    <code>Secret</code> for the passwords, and an <code>InitContainer</code> to
    take the template and the passwords and populate a file that could be used
    by the main container. Easy! ... That said, there were some gotchas along
    the way though that I want to point out too.
</p>

<h2>A minimal <code>Secret</code> for the passwords</h2>

<p>
    The only "secret" information that is contained in the <code>.ini</code>
    files is the password, so it makes more sense to make a <code>Secret</code>
    that contains just the password.
</p>

<p>Here's the config:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: passwords
stringData:
  password1: real-password-1
  password2: real-password-2
type: Opaque
</code></pre>


<p>
    These were then created in the cluster, and the files subsequently deleted,
    like before.
</p>

<p>
    Note that this definitely isn't best practice in terms of security. There
    are safer and more reliable ways of creating secrets that don't rely on
    generating files locally and storing them on disk temporarily. That's
    outside the scope of this post though.
</p>

<h2><code>ConfigMaps</code> for configuration templates</h2>

<p>
    With the passwords now in their own dedicated <code>Secret</code>, we can
    move the configuration files out of the existing <code>Secret</code> and
    into a <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/"><code>ConfigMap</code></a>,
    which ended up looking something like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: templates
data:
  config-1: |
    [database]
    password = PASSWORD
    host = localhost
  config-2: |
    [database]
    password = PASSWORD
    host = localhost
</code></pre>

<p>
    Note that in this example, we end up no longer requiring the
    <code>.ini</code> files, opting to have this configuration moved directly
    into the <code>ConfigMap</code>. In our setup we're using Helm, which allows
    us to use their <a
        href="https://docs.helm.sh/chart_template_guide/">templating language</a> to
    inline the contents of files directly into the yaml, so we can still have
    the <code>.ini</code> files. I'll leave that for another post.
</p>

<h2><code>Volumes</code></h2>

<p>
    The eventual goal is to be able to write the passwords from the
    <code>Secret</code> into the templates contained in the
    <code>ConfigMap</code>, which are mounted into the main container.
</p>

<p>Here's a first pass at the `deploment.yaml` for this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: container-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'cat /etc/config/*; sleep 100']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/templates
          readOnly: true
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: templates
          configMap:
            name: templates
            items:
            - key: config-1
              path: config1.ini
            - key: config-2
              path: config2.ini
        - name: secrets
          secret:
            secretName: passwords
</code></pre>

<p>
    Even though we have the templates and passwords mounted into the container,
    we're not actually doing anything with them here. We still need to combine
    them. This is where the <code>InitContainers</code> are useful.
</p>

<h2><code>InitContainers</code></h2>

<p>
    <a
            href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/"><code>InitContainers</code></a>
    allow you to start one or more containers <i>before</i> the main containers
    start that can do some kind of setup. This might be setting an environment
    variable, or blocking on some condition before allowing the main containers
    to launch. In our use-case, we're going to use them to put the password into
    the templates.
</p>

<p>Here's what my second pass looked like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      - name: init-password-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'sed -i "s/PASSWORD/$(cat /etc/secrets/password-1)/" /etc/config/config1.ini']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: false
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
      - name: init-password-2
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'sed -i "s/PASSWORD/$(cat /etc/secrets/password-2)/" /etc/config/config2.ini']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/templates
          readOnly: false
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
      containers:
      - name: container-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'cat /etc/config/*; sleep 100']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/templates
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: templates
          configMap:
            name: templates
            items:
            - key: config-1
              path: config1.ini
            - key: config-2
              path: config2.ini
        - name: secrets
          secret:
            secretName: passwords
</code></pre>

<p>
    We've used two <code>InitContainers</code> that mount in the
    <code>Secret</code> as read only into <code>/etc/secrets</code>, and the
    <code>ConfigMap</code> as read-write into <code>/etc/config/</code> and then
    inline the password. The same <code>ConfigMap</code> is then mounted into
    the main container at <code>/etc/config</code>, and the container reads the
    contents of the updated config files. Great!
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, there's a subtle problem in that the <code>ConfigMap</code>
    that is mounted into the <code>InitContainers</code> isn't actually
    read-write, even though we've asked for it to be. This makes sense, given
    that it would be weird for the container to make changes to the contents of
    the underlying <code>ConfigMap</code>. Are those changes reflected in the
    map that's stored in the cluster?, etc., etc. The same read only constraints
    apply to <code>Secrets</code>.
</p>

<p>
    There's a nice explanation for it <a
        href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62099">here</a>.
</p>

<h2><code>emptyDir</code> volumes</h2>

<p>
    With the <code>ConfigMap</code> and <code>Secret</code> being read-only
    mounts, we need a way to generate the configuration and persist that
    somewhere temporarily and make that accessible to the main container. We can
    use an <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir"><code>emptyDir</code></a>
    volume for that!
</p>

<p>Here's what the final configuration looked like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: init-password-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'sed "s/PASSWORD/$(cat /etc/secrets/password-1)/" /etc/templates/config1.ini.tmpl > /etc/config/config1.ini']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/templates
          readOnly: true
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: false
      - name: init-password-2
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'sed "s/PASSWORD/$(cat /etc/secrets/password-2)/" /etc/templates/config2.ini.tmpl > /etc/config/config2.ini']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: templates
          mountPath: /etc/templates
          readOnly: true
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: false
      containers:
      - name: container-1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'cat /etc/config/*; sleep 100']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: configs
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: templates
          configMap:
            name: templates
            items:
            - key: config-1
              path: config1.ini.tmpl
            - key: config-2
              path: config2.ini.tmpl
        - name: secrets
          secret:
            secretName: passwords
        - name: configs
          emptyDir: {}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We're now mounting the <code>emptyDir</code> volume into each of the
    <code>InitContainers</code> as read-write and inlining the passwords and
    into templates and persisting that into the <code>emptyDir</code>, which is
    then made accessible to the main container. The container only has read-only
    access to the final configuration file, so there's no chance it can try and
    alter the contents once they are written.
</p>

<p>Here's the final output, that proves we wired it all up correctly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl get pods
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deployment-6d8db67956-4vnzr   1/1       Running   1          1m

$ kubectl logs deployment-6d8db67956-4vnzr
[database]
password = real-password-1
host = localhost
[database]
password = real-password-2
host = localhost
</code></pre>

<p>And done!</p>

<h2>Using tmpfs for secrets</h2>

<p>
    I mentioned as an aside above that it's usually not the best idea to persist
    passwords or key material to disk, and that's what we're doing here. That
    said, if you're using an <code>emptyDir</code>, we can tell it to use an
    in-memory tmpfs as the storage medium, which is much safer. To do that, we
    alter the volume definition in the <code>Deployment</code> as follows:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">volumes:
...
- name: configs
  emptyDir:
    medium: Memory
</code></pre>

<p>And prove to ourselves that it worked:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl get pods
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deployment-5-6f7c6c7787-95vtr   1/1       Running   1          1m

$ kubectl exec -it deployment-5-6f7c6c7787-95vtr -- /bin/sh -c "df -h | grep '/etc/config'"
tmpfs                     1.8G      8.0K      1.8G   0% /etc/config
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    So that's how we can use <code>ConfigMaps</code>, <code>Secrets</code> and
    <code>InitContainers</code> to enable us to combine secret information such
    as passwords with static configuration that is checked into version control
    and ensuring that everything is updated when it changes, rather than
    manually updating <code>Secret</code>'s.
</p>
