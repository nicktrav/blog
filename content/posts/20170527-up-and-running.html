<h1>Up and running!</h1>

<p>
    It took me a little while, but I finally got this thing up and running!
    <i>Hello, world</i>!?
</p>

<p>
    I thought building a site was going to be easy. Sure, it's simple to build
    something to host static pages built on top of WordPress in PHP, but that's
    so mid-2000's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_\(software_bundle\)">LAMP</a>
    anyone?!). I was up for more of a challenge when I started building this, so
    I picked some building blocks that satisfied the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>
        <b>(Relative) Simplicity.</b> I needed to be able to hack something
        together quickly and be able to iterate on it easily without my house of
        cards falling over.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        <b>Familiarity.</b> I wanted to write some code in a language that have
        a passing familiarity with.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        <b>Experimental.</b> Part of putting this together was an excuse to pick
        up some new tools and concepts that I don't have a chance to work with
        in my day-job.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        <b>Open source</b> There's nothing worse that not being able to crack
        something open and see how it works. All the buidling blocks of the site
        need to be available to anyone else to pick up and use.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>
    A site (usually) needs a webserver backing it. Something to serve up the
    content to the clients that connect to it. While the initial goal is to
    serve up static content, I wanted to use somthing that was going to be a
    little more versatile and flexible if I wanted to experiment with something
    fancier in the future.
</p>

<p>
    I use Java at work, so I'm confident working in the JVM ecosystem. The
    tooling and support is pretty extensive and mature, and it's easy to
    StackOverflow your way out of a problem if / when you get stuck. I've been
    learning <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> on the side for a
    while as an excuse to get my head out of the "everything is a noun" approach
    to software development in Java <a
        href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">this</a>
    if you haven't already), so wanted to get my teeth sunk into a decent
    project.
</p>

<p>
    Googling "Scala" and "web development" will probably lead you to the <a
        href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play framework</a>. It's pretty easy
    to use if you're like me and have used another MVC framework like <a
        href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. Given that you're writing Scala,
    it's all statically typed, incuding the HTML templates. Less of those gross
    runtime errors.
</p>

<p>
    I've recently started doing some Golang at work, so maybe if I get sick of
    Play I might have a play around with porting some of this to Go. Who says I
    can't be irresponsible and do a re-write when I want to?!
</p>

<p>
    I've slapped <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> in front of the
    backends as a reverse proxy. It's 2017 and it's better than Apache. Sure,
    I'm not serving up thousands of requests a second, but we use it at work so
    I know a thing or two about how to configure it. It can cache things nicely,
    and terminate SSL (when I get around to it!).
</p>

<h2>Frontend</h2>

<p>
    While HTML was probably the "language" that got me into programming at an
    early age, building small web pages that I could run on the computer I'd
    built from parts I'd picked up at garage sales in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown,_Western_Australia">small
    country town in which I grew up</a> (represent!), it's never really been a
    strong point. Javascript is gross. <b>*#sorrynotsorry*</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Every week there's a new framework on the Orange Website that all the cool
    kids are using. It's exhausting to keep up with. So I'm sticking to my roots
    here and the content for the site is nothing fancy. It's just static HTML
    with some CSS to make things look pretty.
</p>

<p>
    Given the backend is Play / Scala, maybe I'll get around to checking out
    something like <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">scala.js</a> ... maybe.
</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p>
    I've always been a bit of a Google fan-boy, and have used <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a> for a while now, both at work and
    for various side projects, so this was a pretty easy choice. That said, you
    could probably throw this site up on AWS or Digial Ocean pretty easily.
</p>

<p>
    I like how easy and fast it is to iterate on GCP relative to the
    competition. I'm slowly coming around to the idea of "immutable
    infrastructure", where you can treat your VMs as immutable, expendable and
    ephemeral. If something stops working, spin up a replacement and keep
    moving. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute/">GCE</a> is
    pretty good for this, and you can have an instance up and SSH-able in less
    than a minute.
</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>
    Ask any hipster what they're using these days for deploying their artisanal,
    hand-rolled, functional, stateless, reactive microservices and they'll
    probably drop the C-word. "Containers" are pretty much synonymous with <a
        href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> these days (although obviously
    there are others - see <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a> ad and
    <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt">Rkt</a> for two notable examples). Using
    Docker containers unlocks cool frameworks like <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> for service discovery and
    deployment. We've got a pretty similar framework at Square, <a
        href="https://github.com/square/p2">p2</a> that is <i>heavily</i> inspired by
    Kubernetes, so the concepts and abstractions are familiar to me, which is a
    bonus.
</p>

<p>
    Google has a hosted Kubernetes service called <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">Google Container Engine
    (GKE)</a> which abstracts away the pain of adding and removing VMs from your
    cluster and getting them talking to one another.
</p>

<p>
    Kubernetes is another tool I can add to the tool-belt. A bunch of companies
    are already using it (probably in production, but maybe they'd be reluctant
    to admit that openly). The open source community is huge, and the project is
    constantly evolving. No doubt things will look different in a month's time.
    There will be different abstractions to use. Hey - if I ever end up with a
    database backing this thing (god forbid), I'll be keen to checkout how
    Kubernetes deals with <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/">StatefulSets</a>.
</p>

<p>
    So ... here we are. We've got the broad strokes of a website engraved in a
    single HTML document, <a href="https://github.com/nicktrav/blog">checked
    into a Github repo</a>, building and deploying on GCP. I know it works coz
    you're reading it, and I know a thing or two from a past life on how to
    scrape and analyze web logs to tell what kind of browser you're reading it
    from and where you are! ... or at least where the IP of your Tor exit node
    appears to be.
</p>

<p>
    Stay tuned ... my creative juices have to refill. Writing is hard.
