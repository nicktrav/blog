# Preamble

_May 27th, 2017_

I recently started on a new team at Square (the *#traffic*) team. Part of the
reason for the switch was getting out of my comfort zone a little, to focus on
an area of software engineering other than Data, which I've been doing for the
last 2.5 years or so.

Starting on a new team, with new co-workers and new projects presented me with
a great opportunity to finally get around to hacking together a blog. It's
something I've been meaning to do for a while now.

This is also a chance for me to play around with some Scala. I work primarily
in Java and Ruby at Square, but Scala has been on my list of languages to play
around with for a while. This blog is written using the Play framework (2.5.x),
and I'm using Google Cloud Platform to host it.

I'm going to try and hold myself to one entry a (working) day, with each entry
being a short writeup about something that I encountered during the day, or
something I've come across while writing these posts with Scala, Play and GCP.

Let's see how we go!
