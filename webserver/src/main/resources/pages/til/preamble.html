<h3>Preamble</h3>

<em>27rd May, 2017</em>

<p>I recently started on a new team at Square (the <strong>#traffic</strong>)
  team. Part of the reason for the switch was getting out of my comfort zone a
  little, to focus on an area of software engineering other than Data, which I've
  been doing for the last 2.5 years or so.

<p>Starting on a new team, with new co-workers and new projects presented me
  with a great opportunity to finally get around to hacking together a blog. It's
  something I've been meaning to do for a while now.

<p>This is also a chance for me to play around with some Scala. I work
  primarily in Java and Ruby at Square, but Scala has been on my list of
  languages to play around with for a while. This blog is written using the Play
  framework (2.5.x), and I'm using Google Cloud Platform to host it.

<p>I'm going to try and hold myself to one entry a (working) day, with each
  entry being a short writeup about something that I encountered during the day,
  or something I've come across while writing these posts with Scala, Play and
  GCP.

<p>Let's see how we go!
