<h3>Up and running!</h3>

<em>May 27th, 2017</em>

<p>It took me a little while, but I finally got this thing up and running!
  <i>Hello, world!?</i>

<p>I thought building a site was going to be easy. Sure, it's simple to build
  something to host static pages built on top of WordPress in PHP, but that's so
  mid-2000's (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">LAMP</a> anyone?!).
  I was up for more of a challenge when I started building this, so I picked some
  building blocks that satisfied the following:

<ul>
  <li><b>(Relative) Simplicity</b> - I needed to be able to hack something together
    quickly and be able to iterate on it easily without my house of cards
    falling over</li>

  <li><b>Familiarity</b> - I wanted to write some code in a language that have a
    passing familiarity with</li>

  <li><b>Experimental</b> - part of putting this together was an excuse to pick up some
    new tools and concepts that I don't have a chance to work with in my
    day-job</li>

  <li><b>Open source</b> - there's nothing worse that not being able to crack
    something open and see how it works. All the buidling blocks of the site
    need to be available to anyone else to pick up and use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<p>A site (usually) needs a webserver backing it. Something to serve up the
  content to the clients that connect to it. While the initial goal is to serve
  up static content, I wanted to use somthing that was going to be a little more
  versatile and flexible if I wanted to experiment with something fancier in the
  future.

<p>I use Java at work, so I'm confident working in the JVM ecosystem. The
  tooling and support is pretty extensive and mature, and it's easy to
  StackOverflow your way out of a problem if / when you get stuck. I've been
  learning <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> on the
  side for a while as an excuse to get my head out of the "everything is a noun"
  approach to software development in Java (read <a
      href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html"
      target="_blank">this</a> if you haven't already), so wanted to get my teeth sunk
  into a decent project.

<p>Googling "Scala" and "web development" will probably lead you to the <a
    href="https://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play framework</a>.
  It's pretty easy to use if you're like me and have used another MVC framework
  like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a>. Given that
  you're writing Scala, it's all statically typed, incuding the HTML templates.
  Less of those gross runtime errors.

<p>I've recently started doing some Golang at work, so maybe if I get sick of
  Play I might have a play around with porting some of this to Go. Who says I
  can't be irresponsible and do a re-write when I want to?!

<p>I've slapped <a href="https://nginx.org/en/" target="_blank">Nginx</a> in
  front of the backends as a reverse proxy. It's 2017 and it's better than
  Apache. Sure, I'm not serving up thousands of requests a second, but we use it
  at work so I know a thing or two about how to configure it. It can cache things
  nicely, and terminate SSL (when I get around to it!).

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<p>While HTML was probably the "language" that got me into programming at an
  early age, building small web pages that I could run on the computer I'd built
  from parts I'd picked up at garage sales in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown,_Western_Australia" target="_blank">
    small country town in which I grew up</a> (represent!), it's never really been
  a strong point. Javascript is gross. <b>#sorrynotsorry</b>.

<p>Every week there's a new framework on Hacker News that all the cool kids are
  using. It's exhausting to keep up with. So I'm sticking to my roots here and
  the content for the site is nothing fancy. It's just static HTML with some CSS
  to make things look pretty.

<p>Given the backend is Play / Scala, maybe I'll get around to checking out
  something like <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/" target="_blank">scala.js</a>
  ... maybe.

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>I've always been a bit of a Google fan-boy, and have used <a
    href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">GCP</a> for a while now,
  both at work and for various side projects, so this was a pretty easy choice.
  That said, you could probably throw this site up on AWS or Digial Ocean pretty
  easily.

<p>I like how easy and fast it is to iterate on GCP relative to the
  competition.  I'm slowly coming around to the idea of "immutable
  infrastructure", where you can treat your VMs as immutable, expendable and
  ephemeral. If something stops working, spin up a replacement and keep moving.
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute/" target="_blank">GCE</a> is
  pretty good for this, and you can have an instance up and SSH-able in less than
  a minute.

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<p>Ask any hipster what they're using these days for deploying their artisinal,
  hand-rolled, functional, stateless, reactive microservices and they'll probably
  drop the C-word. "Containers" are pretty much synonomous with <a
      href="https://www.docker.com/"target="_blank">Docker</a> these days (although
  obviously there are others - see <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/" target="_blank">LXC</a>
  And <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt" target="_blank">Rkt</a> for two notable
  examples). Using Docker containers unlocks cool frameworks like
  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> for service
  discovery and deployment. We've got a pretty similar framework at Square,
  called <a href="https://github.com/square/p2" target="_blank">p2</a> that is
  <i>heavily</i> inspired by Kubernetes, so the concepts and abstractions are
  familiar to me, which is a bonus.

<p>Google has a hosted Kubernetes service called <a
    href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/" target="_blank">Google
  Container Enginer (GKE)</a> which abstracts away the pain of adding and
  removing VMs from your cluster and getting them talking to one another.

<p>Kubernetes is another tool I can add to the tool-belt. A bunch of companies
  are already using it (probably in production, but maybe they'd be reluctant to
  admit that openly). The open source community is huge, and the project is
  constantly evolving. No doubt things will look different in a month's time.
  There will be different abstractions to use. Hey - if I ever end up with a
  database backing this thing (god forbid), I'll be keen to checkout how
  Kubernetes deals with <a
      href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/"
      target="_blank">StatefulSets</a>!

<p>So ... here we are. We've got the broad strokes of a website engraved in a
  single HTML document, <a href="https://github.com/nicktrav/blog"
                           target="_blank">checked into a Github repo</a>, building and deploying on GCP.
  I know it works coz you're reading it, and I know a thing or two from a past
  life on how to scrape and analyze web logs to tell what kind of browser you're
  reading it from and where you are! ... or at least where the IP of your Tor
  exit node appears to be.

<p>Stay tuned ... my creative juices have to refill. Writing is hard.
